                <h3 class="text-danger">David de Gea</h3>
                <p>Regarded as a highly promising prospect in his youth, De Gea soon developed into one of the best goalkeepers in the world, with some in the sport even labelling him as the current best keeper in the world. De Gea grew up playing futsal as an outfield player until the age of 14, which has helped with his footwork; he has also incorporated various futsal goalkeeping techniques in his play style which shows in his ability to make athletic saves with his feet.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane" id="Pogba">
                <h3 class="text-danger">Paul Pogba</h3>
                <p>Primarily a central midfielder, although he is also capable of playing on the left, in a holding role, as a deep-lying playmaker, in a box-to-box role, or even as an attacking midfielder, Pogba has been described by his club Manchester United as a "powerful, skilful, and creative" player who has "an eye for goal and a penchant for the spectacular." He is also capable of playing as an offensiveâ€“minded central midfielder, who will often drift out wide, known as the "mezzala" role in Italy. During his time in Italy, he gained the nicknames Il Polpo Paul ("Paul the Octopus") for his long legs that look like tentacles during tackling or running and "Pogboom" for his explosive playing style and energy on the pitch. A large, quick, hard-working and physically strong player, he excels in the air and is also known for his stamina, as well as his powerful and accurate striking ability from distance; he has also drawn praise for his finesse, technique, flair and dribbling skills, as well as his ability to hold up the ball.His characteristics and playing role in midfield initially led him to be compared with former France international Patrick Vieira in his youth.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane" id="Bruno">
                <h3 class="text-danger">Bruno Fernandes</h3>
                <p>An attacking midfielder, Fernandes is a direct, energetic box-to-box playmaker who is capable of both taking on defenders and setting the rhythm of play. Directness also means that Fernandes tends to take a lot of risks with the type and level of passes he attempts to complete, especially because he often tries to deliver killer ones. However, despite being prone to turnovers, he typically presses the opposition right after losing possession.In addition, he is an accurate free-kick taker and likes to shoot from outside the penalty area.His movement off the ball is also key, with him often roaming around the attacking areas of the pitch, or dropping deep to pick up possession. As well as operating in the attacking midfielder role, he can also operate in a deeper central midfield role, or as a second striker.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="Rashford">
                <h3 class="text-danger">Marcus Rashford</h3>
                <p>Rashford can play as either a centre forward or a winger, primarily on the left-wing. Rashford himself prefers playing on the left, a position which allows him to cut inside and strike on goal with his stronger right foot. He is a pacey and direct player, and often moves to central positions to create chances and get into goalscoring positions. His manager with England, Gareth Southgate has said his ability to play with his back to goal and his hold-up play weren't his major strengths, and is better suited as a "wide raider" coming in off the wing.</p>
